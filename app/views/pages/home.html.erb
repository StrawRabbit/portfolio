  Belgian student with interests for technology and programmation. Freshly graduated from LeWagon's Web Development bootcamp, I am now seeking a career as a Junior Fullstack Developer. I am mainly interested in a job that that would offer me an opportunity to grow and learn among senior developers.

  <br>
  I studied community management and marketing for a year, and while I unfortunately couldn't maintain all of the knowledge I've gained from that time, I am still familiar with some notions and concepts from that industry. I also did an internship of 2 months among a marketing team where I was able to use that knowledge.

  French being my first language, my english level is pretty advanced (C1). Ever since my childhood I've had a liking for writing and reading stories of all kind, whether it be books, movies or video games. This yearning for storytelling made my skills as a writer natural, which I still try to maintain on a daily basis.
